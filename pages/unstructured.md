Unstructured 2D meshes made of irregular triangles or quads are used in example-unstructured2d.jl to solve a steady state reaction diffusion equation. This demonstrates how to import .MSH files and the unstructured mesh capabilities in 2D. 

3D unstructured hexahedra and tetrahedra are also used for a similar equation in example-unstuctured3d.jl.

The following description is for the 2D case. Begin by importing and using the Femshop module. Then initialize. The name here is only used when generating code files.
```
using Femshop
init_femshop("unstructured2d");
```
Then set up the configuration. This example simply sets dimensionality of the domain and polynomial order of the basis function space.
```
domain(2, grid=UNSTRUCTURED)# dimension, geometry, discretization
functionSpace(order=2)      # basis function polynomial order
```
Import the mesh from a .MSH file and set up all node mappings.
```
mesh("utriangle.msh")     	# Use this line for triangles
mesh("uquad.msh")         	# Use this line for quads
```
Define the variable, test function, and other symbols.
```
u = variable("u")           # same as @variable(u, SCALAR)
testSymbol("v")             # sets the symbol for a SCALAR test function
coefficient("f", "(-10-(x+1)*200*pi*pi)*sin(10*pi*x)*sin(10*pi*y) + 10*pi*cos(10*pi*x)*sin(10*pi*y)")
coefficient("k", "x+1")
coefficient("C", 10)
```
Convert the PDE
<div align="center"><img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\nabla\cdot%20(K\nabla%20u)-Cu=f(x)"> </div>
<div align="center"><img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=u(0)=u(1)=0"> </div>
into the weak form
<div align="center"><img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=-K(\nabla%20u,\nabla%20v)-Cuv=(f,v)"> </div>

The boundary condition is specified.
```
boundary(u, 1, DIRICHLET, "0") # boundary condition for BID 1 is Dirichlet with value 0
```
Then write the weak form expression in the residual form and solve for u.
```
weakForm(u, "k*dot(grad(u), grad(v)) + C*u*v+ f*v")
solve(u);
```
End things with `finalize_femshop()` to finish up any generated files and the log.
